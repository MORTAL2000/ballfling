Playtest notes

 > "Space to reset" unclear. People think it resets the whole level

 > At the very beginning people tend to fling to the right with full velocity. First 
level(s) should account for that

 > sfx important. "door" only understood with sound effects

 > maybe the goal is unclear, i.e, max moves to finish a level
